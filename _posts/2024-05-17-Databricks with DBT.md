In a previous post, [Bigquery with DBT](/posts/BigQuery-with-DBT/), we saw the power of using DBT with Google BigQuery.  But BigQuery is just one of many big data solutions currently available.  Databricks is a another highly popular big data solution that offers powerful data transformation capabilities. It provides a unified analytics platform that combines data engineering, data science, and business analytics, making it a versatile choice for data-driven organizations.

Databricks SQL allows us to interact with our data with ordinary SQL meaning we can use DBT to perform our transformations.
